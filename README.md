**I've coded in VS Code**

Description of files:

### __Basics__
#### Three types of model creation. Three models are same. But the approaches are different. Sequential, Functional, and Class Inheritance.

- :point_right: 01_MNIST_Example.py<br/>
  Downloading MNIST Dataset and plotting sample images
- :point_right: 02_DL_Sequential.py<br/>
  Creating Sequential Model using Tensorflow
- :point_right: 03_DL_Functional_Approach.py<br/>
  Creating a model within method/function
- :point_right: 04_DL_Class_Inherit_Approach.py<br/>
  Creating model by inheriting tensorflow.kera.model class
- :point_right: 05_German_Traffic_Sign_No_Test_Only_Val.py<br/>
  German Street Sign detection using functional model<br/>
  Dataset is taken from Kaggle<br/>
  Dataset is designed in folder by folder structure<br/>
  It's converted into trainable data<br/>
  This file contains mechanism up to validation, not testing.
